# Ethereum
ERC-20 Tokens and thereby connecting to the Ethereum Block Chain via MetaMask.


Source Code and Description: Dapp University 

The Ethereum blockchain allows you to create your own cryptocurrency, or token, that can be purchased with Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-20 is simply a standard that specifies how these tokens behave, so that they are compatible with other platforms like cryptocurrency exchanges.

ERC-20 tokens are created with Ethereum smart contracts.

Ethereum allows developers to write applications that run on the blockchain with smart contracts, which encapsulate all of the business logic of these applications. They enable us to read and write data to the blockchain, as well as execute code. Smart contacts are written in a programming language called Solidity, which looks a lot like Javascript. It is a full blown programming language that will allow us to do many of the same types of things Javascript is capable of, but it behaves a bit differently because of its use case, as weâ€™ll see in this tutorial.

In the case of an ERC-20 token, the smart contract governs all of the behavior about how the token works, and keeps track of token ownership and account balances.

ERC-20 is an API specification for how Ethereum tokens should be built. It is a community adopted standard that allows tokens to be supported in a variety of use cases. We want to build a token that is compliant with this standard so that it can be widely accepted. If we did not have a standard like this, we could have endless ways to create tokens, and they might not be compatible with one another!

Using the ERC-20 standard ensures that a token is compliant for the following use cases:

Wallet transfers - sending tokens from one account to another
Buying and selling on cryptocurrency exchanges
Purchasing tokens in an crowd sale (ICO) like we'll demonstrate in this tutorial
